This is a test post for photo galleries. These are some images I took with my microscope. I'm using [lightGallery](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/) to render the gallery popup and rendering HTML with custom Hugo templates inspired by [this blog post](https://blog.cavelab.dev/2021/04/photo-gallery-posts/).
